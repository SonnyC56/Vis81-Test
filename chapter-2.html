          <p>“The 15th Ward was close-knit. It was like a melting pot,” remembers Eloise Currie, who moved to Syracuse from Georgia when she was 7 years old in 1947. “We had about six bakeries in our little area, we had a fish market, we had a place where you can go get fresh chickens, we had the drugstore, the five-and-dime, we had liquor stores, we had cleaners, and just about everything right here in the 15th Ward. You didn’t have to go very far to get anything.” <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kevincamelo.github.io/soundcites/3EloiseCurrie1.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="28000" data-plays="1">Listen</span></p>

        <p>The <a href="https://prrac.org/pdf/Looking_at_the_legacy_of_I-81.pdf">1951 <em>Negro Motorist Green Book</em></a> lists at least 31 of the prominent Black-owned or Black-friendly businesses in Syracuse at the time, including restaurants, taverns, hotels, beauty parlors, barber shops, and night clubs. These 31 locations are a small sampling of the estimated 400 to 500 businesses torn down in the 15th Ward as part of I-81’s construction and the city’s urban renewal efforts.<br></p>

        <p>“There was a lot of businesses that went out of business when they came through with 81,” Currie said. “And [now] there’s nothing there of the 15th Ward — nothing. Everything is Upstate, the university, and 81.”<br></p>
        <p>Many of the locations listed in the 1951 <em>Green Book</em> have been replaced by large-scale buildings and their parking lots, or vacant lots left undeveloped from the 1960s when urban renewal progress slowed. The razing of the 15th Ward proceeded, despite a lack of guarantee for new development, due in large part to city planners and local newspapers’ framing of the demolition as needed “slum clearance.”<br></p>

        <p>“At one point, the military got involved and a Marine tank was used to demolish a few ‘shacks&#x27; in the area,” wrote Joseph DiMento, a University of California urban planning and law professor, in a report on Syracuse’s urban freeway. “Newspaper articles described the makings of ‘a possible race riot’ as a result of ‘evils nurtured in slums’ and the 15th Ward as a ‘keg of dynamite.’”<br></p>
        <p>But the city and local newspapers’ depiction of the Ward didn’t match up with the perspective of those who lived there. Currie remembered feeling safe in the Ward, and that when she lived there she and her neighbors didn’t lock their doors. John Williams, a best-selling Black author in the 1960s who grew up and lived in the 15th Ward, wrote about the city in his 1964 magazine article “Portrait of a City: Syracuse, the Old Home Town.” Though he didn’t romanticize the city and remembered Syracuse police occupying the Ward like it was a prison, he wrote that the nature of the Ward was that everyone looked out for each other.<br></p>
        <p>“Ours was a community, despite everything else, in which survival of the other fellow or his children meant survival for you,” Williams wrote. “That is all gone now. Now there’s nothing. Not unfriendliness, just nothing.”<br></p>
        <p>Williams lamented the city’s ignorance of the “great strength” that “emanated from that polyglot community,” and the city’s mistreatment that allowed the Ward to fall into disrepair and then destruction. He saw Syracuse’s abandonment and annihilation of its most diverse community as a great failure common in cities across the country and even across the world.<br></p>

          <div class="image-caption">Articles that appeared in the 1950s and 1960s in <em>The Post-Standard</em> and <em>The Herald American</em> framed the I-81 and urban renewal projects of the time as needed “slum clearance.” One <em>Syracuse Herald-Journal</em> article from October 1958 quotes a Syracuse resident as saying “It would be all right with me if they’d take it all. I don’t like the way the city is moving all these colored people in with us—they’d put them right in your living room if you’d let them.” <br><em> Photo Illustration by Amanda Paule</em></div>

        <p>Bryant of Syracuse University thought back to Williams’ article and that perspective he had imparted. “There’s a distinction between the relationships that forge this community and the space,” she said. “Decrepit buildings didn’t necessarily translate into a dysfunctional community.”</p>
        <div class="w-embed">
          <p>Williams’ cousin, Liz Page, explained how urban renewal fractured the community, scattering neighbors in the Ward to all sides of the city. “We’re still trying to rebuild that sense of community,” she said in the <i>15th Ward</i> documentary. “And it’s been replicated over and over and over in every city you find because … people found that the land in the 15th ward was more valuable than we were. So we were forced to move out.” <span class="soundcite" data-url="https://kevincamelo.github.io/soundcites/5LizPage.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="33000" data-plays="1">Listen</span></p>
